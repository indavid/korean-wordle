### David's Korean Wordle JS Clone

This is a Korean version of the popular word-guessing game Wordle. In this game, you have six chances to guess a randomly generated Korean word. Each guess will change the color of the tiles to indicate whether the letter is in the correct position (colored) or in the word but in the wrong position (grey).

# How to Play

1. Use the key buttons or your keyboard to select Korean letters and form your guess.
2. Press/Click the "Enter" button to submit your guess.
3. If a letter is in the word and in the correct position, it will turn green.
4. If a letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it will turn grey.
5. If a letter is not in the word, it will remain white.
6. You have six chances to guess the word correctly.
